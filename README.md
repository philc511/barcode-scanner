various.py
Used to tweak mp3 files which have been ripped from CDs using CDEX program.
Compilations will have the track titles composed of two parts - artist and title.
This will correct the track title and artist, and also set the compilation flag and album artist as various artists

Written to help  compile a list of my lps - I used ZBar barcode scanner program to scan in LPs barcodes 
(where possible) and then this script to call the Discogs site API to identify the LP from the barcode
